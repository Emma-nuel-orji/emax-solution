The beauty of automation beyond the luxury and fascination that it provides is that it creates a level-playing field for everyone to have a normalized experience, eg, the voice interaction between the home and residents living with physical disabilities or visual impairments are top priority considerations that derive our motivation to continually improve these possibilities within the next half-decade. <br><br> Our R&D team is also looking deeply into other areas within our segment market for best strategies to approach the hospitality business in Nigeria. Having raised the bar in the real estate sector in only less than half a decade, we are expanding the horizon of our style, taste and customer base to not only create a new standard for best practice but to raise the bar of excellence to enable us compete globally as a nation. There are a few other areas of possible investments within the stipulated exploratory time frame; including commercial business properties, STEM-specialised tertiary institutions which will birth a project that sits at the heart of our CSR, free learning centres across the 6 geo political zones of the country with internationally standardized curriculum for practical learning.</div>
